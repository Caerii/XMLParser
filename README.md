 Simple Parser for XML documents

# What is an XML document?
 An XML document is a text file that contains a hierarchical structure of data. The data is organized in a tree-like structure, with each node containing a tag and some data. The tag is used to identify the type of data that is contained in the node. The data can be text, numbers, or other tags. The tags can be nested to create a tree-like structure.

# Example XML document.
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<root>
    <child>
        <grandchild>Some text</grandchild>
    </child>
    <child>
        <grandchild>Some more text</grandchild>
    </child>
</root>
```
