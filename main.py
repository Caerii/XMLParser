# How do we parse this?
# We can parse this document by creating a parser object, and then calling the parse() method on the parser object. The parse() method takes a string as an argument, and returns a tree object. The tree object contains the data from the XML document in a tree-like structure. The XML document can be considered a string, because it is a text file.

# How to access the data in the tree?
